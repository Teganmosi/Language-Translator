# Language-Translator

This repository contains a language translation application powered by GPT-3.5 Turbo. With this application, users can easily translate text from one language to another using the state-of-the-art language model. The translation functionality is exposed through a user-friendly web interface built with Gradio.

The application utilizes the `langchain` library, specifically the `ChatOpenAI` and `LLMChain` classes, to interact with the GPT-3.5 Turbo model for language translation tasks. It leverages the power of deep learning and prompt templates to generate accurate translations based on user input.

Key Features:
- Seamless translation of text between different languages.
- Real-time translation updates using the GPT-3.5 Turbo model.
- Easy-to-use web interface powered by Gradio.
- Simple and intuitive user input for source language, target language, and text to translate.

Dependencies:
- `gradio` for creating the web interface.
- `langchain` for interacting with GPT-3.5 Turbo.
- `openai` for API communication with the OpenAI service.
- `python-dotenv` for managing environment variables.

To use the application, users need to install the required dependencies and obtain an OpenAI API key. Instructions for installation and setup can be found in the repository's documentation.

Feel free to contribute to this repository by improving the translation functionality, enhancing the user interface, or adding additional features to extend its capabilities. Your contributions are welcome and will help make language translation more accessible and convenient for users.
